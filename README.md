# Learn GitHub – Final Project

## Introduction
This is the repository created for the final exercise in the Git & GitHub course.
The main goal is to practice basic operations such as:
- Create a repository
- Add LICENSE, README, CODE_OF_CONDUCT and CONTRIBUTING
- Write a sample script (`simple-interest.sh`)
- Use Git CLI to work with branches, forks, pull requests, and merges

## Main content
This repository includes:
- `LICENSE` — Apache License 2.0
- `README.md` — description of the repo information (the file you are reading)
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — code of conduct in the community
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — contribution guidelines
- `simple-interest.sh` — simple interest calculation Bash script

## Applied GitHub knowledge
- Create a repository and manage files on **GitHub UI**
- Use **branch** (`bug-fix-typo`) to fix small errors
- Make a **Pull Request** and merge it into `main`
- Manage the repository using **Git CLI**: clone, commit, push, merge

## How to run the script
Grant execution permission and run:
```bash
chmod +x simple-interest.sh
./simple-interest.sh 1000 5 2
